- Each Plug-in or Fragment may be packaged as a sub-directory
or JAR
(Java(TM) ARchive) in a directory named &quot;plugins&quot;.
- A Feature is a bundle of one or more Plug-ins and/or Fragments
and
associated material.  Each Feature may be packaged as a
sub-directory in a directory named &quot;features&quot;.  Within a Feature,
files named &quot;feature.xml&quot; may contain a list of the names and
version numbers of the Plug-ins and/or Fragments associated with
that Feature.
- Features may also include other Features (&quot;Included
Features&quot;). Within a Feature, files named &quot;feature.xml&quot; may

(&quot;Feature Update License&quot;) during the installation process.
If the
Feature contains Included Features, the Feature Update License
should
either provide you with the terms and conditions governing the
Included Features or inform you where you can locate them.  Feature
Update Licenses may be found in the &quot;license&quot; property of files
