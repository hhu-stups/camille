June 1, 2006  
Usage Of Content  
THE RODIN PROJECT MAKES AVAILABLE SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION
AND/OR OTHER MATERIALS FOR OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS (COLLECTIVELY
&quot;CONTENT&quot;).  USE OF THE CONTENT IS GOVERNED BY THE TERMS AND
CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
OF  
LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW.
BY USING

TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR
NOTICES  
INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE THE CONTENT.
Applicable Licenses  
Unless otherwise indicated, all Content made available by the
Rodin  
Project is provided to you under the terms and conditions of
the  
Eclipse Public License Version 1.0 (&quot;EPL&quot;).  A copy of the EPL
is  
provided with this Content and is also available at  
http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html.  For purposes of the
EPL,  
&quot;Program&quot; will mean the Content.  
Content includes, but is not limited to, source code, object
code,  
documentation and other files maintained in the Rodin SourceForge
CVS  
repository (&quot;Repository&quot;) in CVS modules (&quot;Modules&quot;) and made
available as downloadable archives (&quot;Downloads&quot;).  
- Content may be structured and packaged into modules to facilitate
delivering, extending, and upgrading the Content.  Typical modules
may include plug-ins (&quot;Plug-ins&quot;), plug-in fragments  
(&quot;Fragments&quot;), and features (&quot;Features&quot;).  
- Each Plug-in or Fragment may be packaged as a sub-directory
or JAR  
(Java(TM) ARchive) in a directory named &quot;plugins&quot;.  
- A Feature is a bundle of one or more Plug-ins and/or Fragments
and  
associated material.  Each Feature may be packaged as a  
sub-directory in a directory named &quot;features&quot;.  Within a Feature,
files named &quot;feature.xml&quot; may contain a list of the names and
version numbers of the Plug-ins and/or Fragments associated with
that Feature.  
- Features may also include other Features (&quot;Included  
Features&quot;). Within a Feature, files named &quot;feature.xml&quot; may 
contain a list of the names and version numbers of Included 
Features.  
The terms and conditions governing Plug-ins and Fragments should
be  
contained in files named &quot;about.html&quot; (&quot;Abouts&quot;). The terms and
conditions governing Features and Included Features should be
contained in files named &quot;license.html&quot; (&quot;Feature Licenses&quot;).
Abouts  
and Feature Licenses may be located in any directory of a Download
or  
Module including, but not limited to the following locations:
- The top-level (root) directory  
- Plug-in and Fragment directories  
- Inside Plug-ins and Fragments packaged as JARs  
- Sub-directories of the directory named &quot;src&quot; of certain Plug-ins
- Feature directories  
Note: if a Feature made available by the Rodin Project is installed
using the Eclipse Update Manager, you must agree to a license
(&quot;Feature Update License&quot;) during the installation process. 
If the  
Feature contains Included Features, the Feature Update License
should  
either provide you with the terms and conditions governing the
Included Features or inform you where you can locate them.  Feature
Update Licenses may be found in the &quot;license&quot; property of files
named  
&quot;feature.properties&quot; found within a Feature.  Such Abouts, Feature
Licenses, and Feature Update Licenses contain the terms and conditions
(or references to such terms and conditions) that govern your
use of  
the associated Content in that directory.  
THE ABOUTS, FEATURE LICENSES, AND FEATURE UPDATE LICENSES MAY
REFER TO  
THE EPL OR OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS, NOTICES OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
